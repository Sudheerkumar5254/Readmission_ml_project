Context
Hospital readmissions are a critical issue in healthcare, affecting both patient outcomes
 and hospital costs. A significant number of patients are readmitted within 180 days of 
 discharge due to complications, inadequate post-discharge care, or chronic conditions.
  Predicting patient readmission can help hospitals take preventive measures, improve 
  healthcare services, and reduce costs.

Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital
 within 180 days after discharge.
